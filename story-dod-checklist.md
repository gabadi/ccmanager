# Story Definition of Done Checklist (Developer)

## Purpose

Developer validation checklist to ensure stories meet all technical and quality standards before architect review. This checklist ensures implementation completeness, code quality, and system integration.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - DEVELOPER DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for DEVELOPERS to validate their story implementations before submitting for architect review.

VALIDATION FOCUS:
1. Technical implementation completeness
2. Code quality and standards adherence  
3. Test coverage and validation
4. System integration and compatibility
5. Performance and resource management

EXECUTION APPROACH:
1. Run all automated quality gates (build, test, lint, typecheck)
2. Validate against story acceptance criteria
3. Check for technical debt and maintainability
4. Verify integration with existing system
5. Confirm no regressions introduced

COMPLETION DECISION:
- PASS: All criteria met, ready for architect review
- FAIL: Issues identified, fixes required before review
- BLOCKED: External dependencies or issues preventing completion]]
