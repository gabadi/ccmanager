**Agent**: Architect
**Date**: 2025-06-22
**Workflow Step**: 7 (capture_basic_learning)

## Executive Summary

The dual-mode terminal implementation successfully added bash/Claude toggle functionality to CCManager, demonstrating effective PTY management patterns and React state optimization. The implementation achieved all acceptance criteria with comprehensive test coverage and maintains backward compatibility.

## Learning Categories

### ARCH_CHANGE: Architecture Improvements and Technical Debt

**1. PTY Lifecycle Management Pattern**
- **Learning**: On-demand PTY creation with proper cleanup prevents resource leaks in multi-process terminal applications
- **Evidence**: Session.tsx implements lazy bash PTY creation (line 29-73) with comprehensive cleanup logic
- **Impact**: Prevents memory leaks and orphaned processes in long-running TUI applications
- **Recommendation**: Establish this pattern as architectural standard for any future multi-process features

**2. React Hooks Optimization for PTY Integration**
- **Learning**: useCallback hooks are critical for PTY event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders and memory leaks
- **Evidence**: All PTY-related functions wrapped in useCallback with proper dependency arrays (lines 76-111)
- **Impact**: Prevents performance degradation and memory issues in terminal-heavy React applications
- **Recommendation**: Create architectural guidelines for React hooks usage in PTY management contexts

**3. State Management Boundary Patterns**
- **Learning**: Mixing React state with external process state requires careful boundary management
- **Evidence**: Session state stored both in React useState and session object, with synchronization logic
- **Impact**: Potential state inconsistencies if not managed carefully
- **Recommendation**: Define clear patterns for state ownership between React components and external services

### FUTURE_EPIC: Epic Candidates and Feature Opportunities

**4. Terminal Session Persistence**
- **Learning**: Current bash history management (Session.tsx lines 46-66) provides foundation for full session persistence
- **Evidence**: Buffer-based history with memory limits (5MB) demonstrates scalable persistence approach
- **Opportunity**: Epic for full session recording/playback across both modes
- **Business Value**: Enhanced debugging and workflow reproduction capabilities

**5. Multi-Shell Support Architecture**
- **Learning**: The mode switching architecture (TerminalMode type) can be extended beyond bash/claude
- **Evidence**: Clean abstraction allows for additional terminal types (zsh, fish, PowerShell)
- **Opportunity**: Epic for configurable shell selection per worktree
- **Business Value**: Support for diverse development environments and user preferences

**6. Split-Pane Terminal Interface**
- **Learning**: Dual PTY management demonstrates feasibility of concurrent terminal views
- **Evidence**: Successful management of two PTY instances with independent I/O streams
- **Opportunity**: Epic for side-by-side Claude/bash view without mode switching
- **Business Value**: Enhanced productivity for users who need both interfaces simultaneously

### PROCESS_IMPROVEMENT: Development Workflow Enhancements

**7. Test-Driven PTY Development**
- **Learning**: Node-pty mocking patterns enable comprehensive testing of terminal features
- **Evidence**: 11 comprehensive tests covering initialization, cleanup, state management, and edge cases
- **Impact**: Reduces PTY-related bugs and enables confident refactoring
- **Recommendation**: Establish PTY testing patterns as standard practice for terminal feature development

**8. Memory-Bounded Buffer Management**
- **Learning**: Proactive memory management for terminal buffers prevents runaway memory usage
- **Evidence**: Bash history implementation with size limits and automatic cleanup (lines 52-65)
- **Impact**: Prevents application crashes in long-running sessions
- **Recommendation**: Apply memory-bounded patterns to all buffer management in the application

**9. Graceful Error Handling in Process Management**
- **Learning**: PTY operations can fail unpredictably; graceful degradation is essential
- **Evidence**: Try-catch blocks around PTY resize operations (lines 158-166, 196-202)
- **Impact**: Prevents application crashes when external processes fail
- **Recommendation**: Audit all PTY operations for error handling completeness

### TOOLING: Infrastructure and Automation Improvements

**10. PTY Testing Infrastructure**
- **Learning**: Mock PTY classes with EventEmitter enable realistic terminal testing
- **Evidence**: MockPty class implementation in test file provides comprehensive PTY simulation
- **Opportunity**: Extract mock PTY utilities into shared testing infrastructure
- **Impact**: Accelerates development of future terminal features

**11. Terminal State Validation**
- **Learning**: TypeScript unions for terminal modes provide compile-time safety
- **Evidence**: TerminalMode type ('claude' | 'bash') prevents invalid mode assignments
- **Opportunity**: Extend type validation to other state management areas
- **Impact**: Reduces runtime errors and improves code maintainability

**12. Configuration Management Patterns**
- **Learning**: Shortcut configuration system demonstrates scalable keyboard mapping
- **Evidence**: Integration with existing shortcut system for Ctrl+T toggle
- **Opportunity**: Create configuration management utilities for complex feature settings
- **Impact**: Enables user customization without code changes

### KNOWLEDGE_GAP: Team Training and Skill Development Needs

**13. React Hooks in PTY Context**
- **Gap**: Team may not fully understand React hooks optimization for external process integration
- **Evidence**: Initial implementation had dependency array issues resolved during development
- **Training Need**: Workshop on React hooks best practices for system integration
- **Priority**: High - Critical for future React + system integration features

**14. Node.js PTY Process Management**
- **Gap**: Limited team experience with PTY lifecycle management and resource cleanup
- **Evidence**: Complex cleanup logic required for dual PTY scenario
- **Training Need**: Deep dive on node-pty, process management, and resource cleanup patterns
- **Priority**: Medium - Important for robustness of terminal features

**15. Terminal Emulation and ANSI Codes**
- **Gap**: Team knowledge of terminal control sequences and display management
- **Evidence**: Status indicator implementation uses ANSI escape sequences (lines 80-86)
- **Training Need**: Terminal emulation fundamentals and ANSI code reference
- **Priority**: Low - Specialized knowledge for terminal UI features
